HOW TO RUN MESA CODE FOR THE FIRST TIME
Use the tutorial on MESA's "getting started" page
http://mesa.sourceforge.net/starting.html

Open a terminal and type in the following commands:
cp -r $MESA_DIR/star/work a-MESA/Project_Name
cd a-MESA/Project_name
./mk
( Fill out inlists. )
./rn




HOW TO RUN MESA CODE WHEN A DIRECTORY HAS ALREADY BEEN SETUP
This is what you'll be doing the majority of the time. If there was a previous run, empty the "logs" and "photos" folders you're using, and delete any ".mod" files created (not sure if necessary, but I always do it). Then simply navigate to the correct folder and run the file "rn". No "MESA-specific" terminal inputs are required.

cd a-MESA/0p8M_all
./rn

To write terminal output to a file (instead of the terminal itself) with arbitrary name "log" (file extension optional), the second line becomes
./rn > log
I recommend saving ALL terminal output; you never know when you may need to look at an old run when troubleshooting. It also prevents the extreme cluttering of the terminal that MESA produces. Use a good naming convention, e.g. terminal_YYYYMMDD_briefdescription.txt




USEFUL MESA FILES DEFINING INLIST COMMANDS, OUTPUT COLUMNS, INTERNAL VARIABLES ETC
Many are contained within the folder at
$MESA_DIR/star/defaults
The following files are also extremely useful:
$MESA_DIR/chem/public/chem_def.f90 # Has a list of all isotopes included in the code, and their initial abundances
$MESA_DIR/chem/public/chem_lib.f90
$MESA_DIR/const/public/const_def.f90
$MESA_DIR/const/public/const_lib.f90
$MESA_DIR/net/public/net_def.f90
$MESA_DIR/net/public/net_lib.f90
It's recommended to copy these to a convenient location so you can refer to them whenever needed.




CUSTOMISING OUTPUT
You can choose the data columns to include in output files by placing "history_columns.list" and "profile_columns.list" in the directory.
History: Global quantities at each timestep, eg M, L
Profile: Spatially-varying quantities at each timestep, eg rho, P




USEFUL COMMAND LINE PROMPTS

grep -lr "hello world" ./ -s > "hello world files"
Searches the current directory (including all subfolders) for all files containing "hello world" within their contents. Outputs the list to a file "hello world files". Useful for locating a subroutine that fails during a code.

dir /b/s *file.txt*
Searches the entire directory (including nested files) for the file any file containing "file.txt". Doesn't seem to work though.

find . -name file.txt
As above, but works. This is a linux command.




USING TEST_SUITE
Open "make" / "makefile" and delete the line
MESA_DIR = ../../../
Then open the inlist files and delete the line
mesa_dir = ../../../

These are "relative paths" and tell the code to go up three levels. But this is no longer true when we have made a copy (i.e. not saved in $MESA_dir/star/test_suite).

May need to go into each inlist file and change other paths to absolute paths. So check each project fully before running it.




THE "mkdir failed" ERROR
Immediately after you run the "./rn" file, the following error message appears:
 mkdir failed for usr/local/mesa/data/eosDT_data/cache
 error code
File: ../public/utils_lib.f, line:  836
followed by 11 backtrace steps.
There is nothing that you're doing wrong if this happens! It is a strange random error; it happened roughly once every few months for me. I don't know why it happens, but it looks like MESA tries to create some empty folders as a "cache" for temporary output when you run it, but something prevents it from making these folders and it fails immediately. There is no solution that I know of; just keep trying to run it occasionally and it will suddenly work again. For me, it took 1-4 days.
