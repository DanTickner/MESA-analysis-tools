# MESA-analysis-tools
Analysis and automation tools for the MESA stellar evolution code, implementation of rotation and atomic diffusion, toward reproduction of the Spite plateau.

Documents supporting MSc final project. PDF to be added once grades have been finalised.

We develop improved and enhanced analysis tools for the stellar evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), aimed at giving rapid turnaround when working on large, repetitive simulation tasks.

The inlists are designed for low-mass, low-metallicity halo stars to be evolved toward the main sequence turnoff. The goal is to evolve a population of these stars with varying masses in order to reproduce the Spite plateau.

The file "placeholder" containing text "placeholder" was uploaded in four subfolders of "a-MESA": "LOGS", "z_Logs", "z_Mods" and "z_Photos". It is important to demonstrate the file structure used during the project, but GitHub does not support empty folders and will simply delete them. When downloading and using this setup for yourself, the four occurrences of this file can be safely deleted.

All files in this repository were produced entirely by myself. I give full permission to use, modify, redistribute and republish them to suit your own needs. If used in any public material, a URL link to this repository in a footnote would be appreciated.
