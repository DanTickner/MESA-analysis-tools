# MESA-analysis-tools
Analysis and automation tools for the MESA stellar evolution code, implementation of rotation and atomic diffusion, toward reproduction of the Spite plateau

Documents supporting MSc final project. PDF to be added once grades have been finalised.

We develop improved and enhanced analysis tools for the stellar evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), aimed at giving rapid turnaround when working on large, repetitive simulation tasks.

The inlists are designed for low-mass, low-metallicity halo stars to be evolved toward the main sequence turnoff. The goal is to evolve a population of these stars with varying masses in order to reproduce the Spite plateau.
