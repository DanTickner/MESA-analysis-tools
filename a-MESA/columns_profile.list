! General
 zone       ! numbers start with 1 at the surface
 mass       ! m/Msun. Mass coordinate of outer boundary of cell.
 logR       ! log10(radius/Rsun) at outer boundary of zone.
 logT       ! log10(temperature) at center of zone.
 logRho     ! log10(density) at center of zone.
 logP       ! log10(pressure) at center of zone.

! Needed to calculate partial densities of each element
 radius_cm ! radius at outer boundary of zone (in cm)
 dr ! radial extent of zone (in cm)
 dm ! cell mass (grams)

! Abundances
x_mass_fraction_H
y_mass_fraction_He
z_mass_fraction_metals
add_abundances ! Mass fractions of all isotopes in the current net. Keep at end of list - unspecified number of columns.
